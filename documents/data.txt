Course Title                    : Electromagnetic Theory II

Instructors                      : Sarmistha Banik, Sashideep Gutti

Scope and Objective of the Course:
Working knowledge of EMT is a must to be a good physicist. It is the foundation for the technologies of
EE, ECE and computer engineering, spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from dc to light. In
EMT-I we assembled electrodynamics piece by piece and covered upto Maxwell’s equations. Now it’s time
to appreciate the extraordinary power and richness of electrodynamics. We will see that Maxwell’s
equations represent a fundamental unification and interdependence of electric and magnetic fields and
predict electromagnetic wave phenomena. These waves move with speed of light and here we make a
connection between EMT and optics. Also we study the physical phenomenon of electromagnetic radiation
through Maxwell’s equations. Finally, we introduce the other major conceptual advance in electromagnetic
theory i.e. Einstein’s special theory of relativity.
